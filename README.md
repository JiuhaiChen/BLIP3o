**AR + Diffusion Architecture**: Similar with BLIP3o, BLIP3o-NEXT generates intermediate features via the autoregressive model and then conditions on these features to generate images through the diffusion model.

**Discrete Image Token Supervision**: We add discrete SigLIP-2 image token prediction as extra training supervision, jointly optimizing CrossEntropy and the diffusion objective. By having the AR model lay down a discrete "blueprint" and feeding their hidden representations into the diffusion model, we combine structural accuracy with high visual-fidelity image outputs.

**RL with verified reward**: The introduction of discrete image tokens unlocks seamless compatibility with existing language-model RL framework. Using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO), we train the BLIP3o-NEXT to improve prompt alignment and text rendering in image generation.

Install package for pretraining and instruction tuning
```Shell
conda create -n blip3o-next python=3.11 -y
conda activate blip3o-next
pip install --upgrade pip  setuptools
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install -e .
```


Import slurm config and environment
```Shell
sbatch  scrips/run.sh
```


For GRPO, we recommend to install a new enviroment since some version conflicts for torch if using blip3o-next environment. Also you need to install the dependency from  [setup.py](https://github.com/JiuhaiChen/BLIP3o/blob/BLIP3o-NEXT/setup.py), please follow below


```Shell
cd trl
conda create -n grpo python=3.11 -y
conda activate grpo
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..
pip install -e .
```
